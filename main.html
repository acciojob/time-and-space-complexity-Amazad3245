	<h1>Time and Space Complexity.</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is very important to solve any coding problem to min Time complexity and efficient to optimize solution so that our CPU take very less time to exute our code in efficient mennar.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm to run, relative to the size of the input data and to solve any array proble to itrate array of O(n).</p>
